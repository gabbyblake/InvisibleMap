Next, create a map by marking one April tag at a time as you walk the route you want to create on the map. As you walk the route, you may drop points of interest on the map by adding locations at any time. Once you are done walking the route, we recommend walking the route backwards and marking the previously marked tags a second time in the opposite direction. Finally, you may save and name the map. After saving the map, the map should be automatically uploaded to the Invisible Map app. \n\nNOTE: It may take a few minutes for the map to successfully upload on the Invisible Map Creator and Invisible Map apps.")
